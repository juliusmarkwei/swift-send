This project serves as a task as part of my recruitment process for a Backend Engineering role. It represents an opportunity for me to showcase my skills and expertise in developing backend solutions using Django, a powerful web framework for Python.

Throughout this project, I demonstrated my proficiency in various aspects of backend development, including:

1. **Database Design and Management**: Designing and implementing efficient database models to store and manage data effectively of which I used the <strong>`Postgres Database`</strong> from <a href="https://supabase.com/database">Supabase</a> a Cloud Database Plateform

2. **API Development**: I created robust APIs to facilitate communication between any SMS frontend and this backend application. Utilizing the <strong>`Django`</strong> and <strong>`Django Rest Framework`</strong>, I was able to achieve this with a few lines of code.

3. **Testing**: I wrote a comprehensive tests with the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/">Pytest-Cov</a> library to ensure the reliability and stability of the backend codebase.

4. **Documentation**: With the help of the <a href="https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html">DRF-Spectacular</a> library, I was able to generate a clear and concise documentation to guide future developers and users of the system.

5. **Deployment**: Finally, I deployed the application to <a href="https://www.koyeb.com/">Koyeb</a> production environment, ensuring that it is secure, scalable, and accessible to end-users.
